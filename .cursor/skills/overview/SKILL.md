# Overview

The system allows users to visually create, configure, and execute automated
workflows on a blockchain. Users design sequences of actions as nodes, which are
executed deterministically by isolated wallets. The platform handles
authentication, subscription access, and workflow execution, providing feedback
and logging while keeping user assets secure. The core idea is to enable
programmable, repeatable on-chain operations without requiring deep technical
knowledge from the user.
